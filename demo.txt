For Windows:
Create a Batch Script to Run the Application:

Create a batch file (e.g., startMyApp.bat) with the following content:
batch

@echo off
cd C:\path\to\your\jar\directory
java -jar your-application.jar
Save it in a specific folder like C:\Scripts.
Create a Task to Run the Batch File at Startup:

Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc to open Task Scheduler.
Click Create Task on the right-hand side.
In the General tab, name your task (e.g., Start MyApp).
In the Triggers tab, click New, then select Begin the task: At startup.
In the Actions tab, click New, then browse to your batch file (C:\Scripts\startMyApp.bat) and select it.
In the Conditions tab, uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power if necessary.
In the Settings tab, check Allow task to be run on demand and If the task fails, restart every with appropriate settings.
Click OK to save the task.
Reboot to Test:

Restart your computer, and the application should run automatically on startup.
Additional Considerations:
Run as a specific user: Ensure the application runs as the user with the correct permissions to access required files and resources.
Logging: Ensure that your application writes logs somewhere persistent for debugging. You can redirect output to log files or set up specific logging configurations.
Auto-restart: The Restart=on-failure option in the Linux service file ensures that your application will automatically restart if it crashes.
After following these steps, your application should automatically run when your computer starts up.

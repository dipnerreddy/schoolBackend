# Billing Software for Schools

This project is a comprehensive billing software designed specifically for Radiant High School. It enables the school management to efficiently add and manage student, parent, and staff information in a centralized database. The software also streamlines the process of collecting fees from students.

The backend of the system is powered by Java Spring Boot, ensuring robust and secure handling of data, while the frontend is a modern, responsive web application built using React and styled with Bootstrap for a smooth user experience. PostgreSQL serves as the database for reliable and scalable data storage. Additionally, SonarQube is integrated into the development pipeline to maintain high code quality through continuous testing and analysis.

This solution is tailored to meet the administrative and billing needs of Radiant High School, providing a user-friendly and efficient way to manage their financial operations.
